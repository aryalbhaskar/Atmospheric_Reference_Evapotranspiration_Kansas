# Modeling Atmospheric Reference Evapotranspiration: A Case Study from the Ashland Bottoms Station, Kansas Mesonet
## Introduction
This project models atmospheric reference evapotranspiration (ETo) using data from the Ashland Bottoms station of the Kansas Mesonet near Manhattan. ETo, representing the combined evaporation and transpiration of a well-watered reference crop, is a crucial metric in agriculture and hydrology. Analyzing the dataset, helps us understand the atmospheric demand for water and its implications for resource management.
